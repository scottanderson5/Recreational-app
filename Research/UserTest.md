User Test:

User was tasked with being the role of a captain, and going to the page where he/she could alter the team lineup (see corresponding photos for reference).

1. User initially tried to press the button for the Current Lineups, which would only take them to the current lineup with no edit option. 
2. User went back to home screen with the Left Arrow Button in the upper left corner (might change to a logo).
3. User hit the Menu Button in the Upper Right corner. Again, not the intended route.
4. User went back to the home page.
5. User clicked on My Profile. Which led to the eventual page which allowed the user to alter the teams lineup for a chosen date.

Findings:

1. Need to Change the Current Lineups tab to something else. Perhaps Current Teams, which then could lead into the Lineups for them to see.
2. Change the My Profile Button to something else, like "Captains Corner".Maybe not though, changing the button "Current Lineups" to something else may solve the problem.
3. Hamburger menu in the top right corner may not be necessary.
