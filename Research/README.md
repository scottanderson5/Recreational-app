	User Story (Dave)
		Dave logs on to the app to access his lineup and position chart he created earlier for the game.

	Scenario (Dave)
		Prior to the game being played that night, Dave sent the lineup and position chart out the rest of the team. After warmups and a general strategy session, one of the players runs up, out of breath and late, to Dave. Explaining that she had to stay late at work and then got stuck in traffic on the way over she tells him she hasn't had time to look at the lineup or position chart he previously sent out. Dave takes out the app and pulls up the charts, then tells her what position she is playing and the number she holds in the kicking lineup.

	Scenario (Tony)
		Tony is considering wether he is going to show up and play tonight. His girlfriend has been complaining that kickball is starting to take up to much of this time, and she doesn't get to see him as much. He logs onto the app and see that Dave has pushed up the lineups. After seeing that he will be kicking near the end of the lineup and that he is only playing right field every other inning, he decides to skip playing kickball that night and go out with his girlfriend.
