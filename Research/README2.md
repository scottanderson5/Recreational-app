Web App Inspirations

1. Hilton HHonors App
    http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/hhonors-mobile-app/index2.html

    - Main Reasons people use the app:
        + Search for hotels in a certain city and make reservations
        + Check on their current reservations
        + Check for the amount of current points they have 
        
    - App is well designed for these things:
        + Search bar is in the middle of the app, first thing the user will see when they log in and want to search for a place to stay, most likely the number one reason they use the app
        + At the bottom is all of the info the need on cruurent reservations, with easy swiping access and easily accesible features
        + The number of points someone currrently has is currently displayed at the top. Not too prevalent, which it doesn't have to be because thats not the main reason the user will log in. But there are users who will want a quick reference, and it is still there and easy to reference. 
        + More advanced features are easily accessed through the "hamburger" menu in the upper right

2. Southwest Airlines Mobile App
    https://www.southwest.com/mobile/

    - Main Reasons People use the app:
        + Make airline reservations
        + Check current flight status
        + Check In for their flight
        + Check their rapid rewards points
    
    - App is well/poorly designed for these things:
        + Book flight is in bar at bottom of page. 
        + Offers is first page when user opens the app, you need to switch to another page to see search bar for reservation search.
        + Main reason user most likely uses app is to check in for a flight. This feature is at the bottom of the page. Not to hard to find, but maybe not featured prominently enough. 
        + Rapid Rewards is at the top of the app. A good spot. Similar to the Hilton HHonors app, easy to see, but not too prominently displayed. 
        + Flight Status is located on the bottom bar along with Check In and Book Flight. This is a good spot for it.

3. Opentable Mobile App
    http://www.opentable.com/m/mobile-apps/

    - Main reasons people use the app:
        + Search for restaurants
        + Book reservations at restaurants
        + Check for current point balance
    
    - App is well/poorly designed for these things:
        + It is easy to search for the restaurant by place and time 
        + Restaurants located close by are well displayed with avaiable times close to the current time. 
        + To find the amount of points a user has they have to click to the profile page. Not hard to do, but the amount of points a user currently has could be displayd somewhere on the home page, and not the profile page.
